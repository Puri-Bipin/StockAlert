# StockAlert

 A simple Flask-based web application that allows users to monitor stock prices and receive alerts via email when the price of a particular stock exceeds a certain threshold. 
 The app uses the Yahoo Finance API to fetch the current stock prices and the apscheduler library to schedule recurring tasks. 
 It also integrates with the Mailgun email service to send email notifications. The app is designed to be scalable and can support multiple users concurrently.
